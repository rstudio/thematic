# thematic 0.1.1.9000

* Closed #90: Enabling thematic no longer fails when used with package(s) that resgiter `{ggplot2}` methods via `registerS3method()` within `.onLoad()` (`{zoo}` is one such package that does this). (#90)
* Closed #86: thematic_rmd() now works as expected in `shiny: runtime` Rmd documents (#87)
* Closed #82: Fixed a bug with element_blank() in plot-specific user code not being respected by thematic. (#83) 

# thematic 0.1.1

* Initial release of the package, see https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/
