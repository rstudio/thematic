Unified and automatic theming of **ggplot2**, **lattice**, and **base** R graphics.

## Installation

**thematic** is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but you can install it now with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/thematic")
library(thematic)
```

In addition, for the auto-theming integration with **shiny**, you currently need:

```r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/shiny")
```

And, for auto-theming in `rmarkdown::html_document()`:

```r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown#1706")
```

If you'd prefer to not install these experimental versions, and just want to play around with some **thematic** examples, take a test drive on **RStudio Cloud**:

  </a>
</div>


## Getting started

**thematic** sets various graphing defaults based on a few different color and font settings. The main settings are background, foreground, `accent`, and `font`. These particular setting here intentionally match the styling of **thematic**'s [website](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/).

```{r}
library(thematic)
thematic_on(
  bg = "#222222", fg = "white", accent = "#0CE3AC", 
  font = font_spec("Oxanium", scale = 1.25)
)
```

Now, any future plot(s) inherit these settings (at least until `thematic_off()` is called):

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

In addition, **thematic** sets new defaults for qualitative color-scales (the default is based color-blind safe `okabe_ito()` color palette, but this may be customized via the `qualitative` argument to `thematic_on()`):

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_smooth(color = "white") 
```

It also sets new defaults for `sequential` color scales based on the `accent`, `bg`, and `fg` (this default is also configurable via the `sequential` argument):

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "white") 
```

## Auto theming

**thematic** also has the ability to automatically detect the relevant colors and fonts in some scenarios, based on the current plotting context. The `bg`, `fg`, and `accent` arguments all default to `'auto'` because they generally work where available, but you currently must opt-in to font detection:

```r
thematic_on(font = "auto")
```

Auto theming works best with a [**shiny** runtime](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/shiny.html), but it can also work under certain conditions inside [**rmarkdown**](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/rmarkdown.html) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/rstudio.html). For a quick demonstration, here's a **shiny** app styled with a dark background, light foreground, and a Google Font (e.g. Pacifico), **thematic** can automatically mimic those styles in the R plots.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/eWXYtis.gif")
```

## Font support

If a Google Font (e.g., [Oxanium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium), [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico), etc) which isn't already known to R is requested, **thematic** attempts to download, cache, and register that font for use with **showtext** and **ragg** before plotting. That means, if you have **showtext** installed, Google Fonts work 'out-of-the-box' in **shiny** and **rmarkdown**. Moreover, **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and RStudio can all be configured to use  **ragg** as well, which can also render custom fonts. For more details, see the Google Font rendering sections of the **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and RStudio articles.

Of course, you can also specify fonts that are already known to R without necessarily have **showtext** or **ragg**. If you'd like to use a font that isn't already known to R (and isn't a Google Font),
point `sysfonts::font_add()` (for **showtext**) or `systemfonts::register_font()` (for **ragg**) to the font files.

<!--

With **thematic** now enabled, static R plots generated via a **shiny** app automatically adopt the styling of their HTML container(s). For example, the **shiny** app below uses **shinythemes** and the [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) for styling the HTML; and thanks to **thematic**, those styles are automatically reflected in the R plots. Note that, in the case that the Pacifico font isn't available to R, **thematic** will detect a lack of support, download font files via the Google Font API (unless told otherwise), cache them (see `font_cache_set()`), and register them for use with both **showtext** and **ragg** (one of these two packages must be installed to actually render the auto-installed fonts).

...

By the way, **thematic** works regardless of how the **shiny** app is actually styled (in fact, [**bootstraplib**](https://rstudio.github.io/bootstraplib/articles/recipes.html), not **shinythemes**, will soon be our recommended way to style **shiny** apps). The only requirement is that, for font rendering, you must either use a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) (and have **showtext** or **ragg** installed) or make sure R already has the ability to render the font (which can be done manually via **extrafont**, **showtext**, or **ragg**).

## Auto vs specified themes

Auto theming is guaranteed to work inside of a **shiny** runtime, but in other situations<sup>1</sup>, you may want to specify the colors and/or fonts prior to plot generation.

```{r}
thematic_on(
  bg = "#FFFFF8", fg = "#111111", accent = "#DD1144",
  font = font_spec("Tangerine", scale = 2)
)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ], aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~cut) + ggtitle("Diamond price by carat and cut with tufte styling")
```

## Rendering of custom fonts

Rendering of 'custom' Google Fonts (i.e., Google Fonts not generally available to R) requires either the **showtext** or the **ragg** package to be installed. For Google Font rendering to work 'out-of-the-box' with both **shiny** and **rmarkdown**, make sure **showtext** is installed. If you want a plot with custom fonts outside of **shiny** and **rmarkdown**, consider using `thematic_save_plot()` as RStudio's graphics device currently doesn't support custom fonts at all (if you'd like to preview the file that `thematic_save_plot()` generates in RStudio, you can use `file.show()`).

If you want custom font(s) that aren't hosted by Google Fonts, you'll currently need to download and register them with R yourself. After downloading the font files, you can use `sysfonts::font_add()` (for **showtext**) and/or `systemfonts::register_font()` (for **ragg**) to register them with R. Another, more expensive, but more permanent (i.e., you only have to do it once, instead of everytime you start a new R session) solution to make custom fonts available to R is via `extrafont::import_font()` and `extrafont::loadfonts()`.

If you have **showtext** installed and custom Google Font rendering still fails in **rmarkdown**, you can likely fix it by doing one of the following in a "setup" chunk (i.e., a **knitr** code chunk that appears at the top of the document which sets up [chunk options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) defaults and other global state):
  1. Include `knitr::opts_chunk$set("fig.showtext" = TRUE)`, which enables **showtext** in all *future* code chunks.
  2. Load **thematic** (e.g., `library(thematic)`), which will call `knitr::opts_chunk$set("fig.showtext" = TRUE)` for you.

<hr/>

1. Auto theming works in **rmarkdown** with `runtime: shiny` and also in `html_document_base()` based output formats with a non-`NULL` `theme` (i.e., powered by **bootstraplib**). With time, hopefully most other **rmarkdown** output formats will use `auto_config()` (internally) so that `'auto'` values can work the way you'd expect them to (at least by default). Note also that `accent='auto'` and `font='auto'` currently doesn't work with custom RStudio themes.
