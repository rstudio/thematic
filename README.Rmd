Simple and automatic theming of **ggplot2**, **lattice**, and **base** graphics.

## Installation

**thematic** is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but you can install it now with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("cpsievert/thematic")
library(thematic)
```

## Getting started

**thematic** provides a single entry point to controling the main colors and fonts of **ggplot2**, **lattice**, and **base** graphics. To start a (global) theme, give `thematic_begin()` background/foreground/accent colors and a `font_spec()`. All of these arguments are optional, but **thematic** works best if you specify at least `bg`/`fg`/`accent`.

```{r}
library(thematic)
thematic_begin(
  bg = "#444444", fg = "#e4e4e4", accent = "#749886", 
  font = font_spec(family = "Oxanium", scale = 1.25, auto_install = TRUE)
)
```

As you'll see in the examples below, **thematic** uses these colors to inform consistent defaults not only for the plot's overall theme (e.g., plot/panel background, text color, etc), but also for `accent`ed graphical markers (e.g., **ggplot2** geom defaults), as well as `sequential` and `qualitative` color scales (these scaling defaults can also be controlled via `thematic_begin()`). `thematic_begin()` works by modifying global state in such a way that all your future plots "just work" (with [some exceptions]()), so best practice is to call `thematic_end()` when you're done using **thematic**.

## ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions, z = density)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = density)) + 
  geom_contour()
```

See the ggplot2 article for more examples and explanation.

### Base

Base R graphics don't have a "global" notion of `sequential` colorscales (i.e., they must be implemented as a part of each plotting call); but in most cases, you can provide the current sequential colorscale by doing something like `col = thematic_current("sequential")`:

```{r}
image(volcano)
image(volcano, col = thematic_current("sequential"))
```
 
## Lattice

```{r}
lattice::show.settings()
```


## Google fonts

There are two main controls for fonts currently: `family` and `scale`. `scale` (defaults to 1) is multiplied against all relevant font sizes. If `family` references a font that doesn't exist on the system, but the font is available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), **thematic** will try to download and register the font files for you (as long as `auto_install = TRUE`).

```{r}
font <- font_spec(family = "Oxanium", scale = 1.25, auto_install = TRUE)
thematic_begin("black", "white", font = font)
p
```

```{r}
thematic_end()
p
```

## With shiny auto-theming

**shiny** uses **thematic**'s functionality to implement it's auto-theming feature. 

TODO: an example of overriding auto-theming defaults

## Known issues

* Auto-installed fonts currently don't work at all with the RStudio graphics device. They should generally work with other graphics devices (i.e., **rmarkdown**/**knitr**) _if_ you have the **showtext** package installed. In the case you don't want to take a dependency on **showtext**, you can use `thematic_with_device()`, which will  (with `device = safe_device()`), which 

```r
font <- font_spec(family = "Caveat", scale = 1.25)
thematic_begin("black", "white", font = font)
file <- thematic_with_device(plot(1), res = 144)
```

If you're in RStudio, you can preview the resulting `file` with `file.show(file)`. Moreover, to embed the `file` in **rmarkdown**/**knitr**, do `knitr::include_graphics(file)`.
