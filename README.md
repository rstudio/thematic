Simplified theming of **ggplot2**, **lattice**, and **base** R graphics.
In addition to providing a [centralized
approach](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/custom.html) to
styling R graphics, **thematic** also enables [automatic
styling](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html) of R
plots in Shiny, R Markdown, and RStudio.

Installation
------------

**thematic** is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org),
but you can install it now with:

    remotes::install_github("rstudio/thematic")
    library(thematic)

For [auto theming in
Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#shiny),
you’ll need **shiny** v.1.5.0 or higher.

    install.packages("shiny")

For [auto theming in R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rmd),
you’ll currently need an experimental version of **rmarkdown**:

    remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown#1706")

Overview
--------

**thematic**’s [auto
theming](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html) gives R
plots the ability to style themselves inside
[Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#shiny)
(via CSS), [R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rmd)
(via **bslib**), and
[RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rstudio)
(via [RStudio
themes](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes)).
For a quick example, here’s a `shiny::tabsetPanel()` with custom CSS
styling, but default R styling:

<img src="man/figures/auto-before.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

To add automatic coloring and fonts (i.e., the full auto theming
experience) to the R plots, simply call `thematic_on(font = "auto")` and
re-run the application. Since the plots are generated via Shiny, they
assume new defaults which are informed by the CSS styling on their HTML
container (that is, notice how the R plots now reflect the styling of
the `shiny::tabsetPanel()`). Moreover, as long as the relevant font is a
[Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) (in this case,
[Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico)), **thematic**
automatically downloads, caches, and registers font(s) with R.

<img src="man/figures/auto-after.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Instead of relying on **thematic** to automatically detect colors and
fonts in the plot’s container, you can also specify them directly in
`thematic_on()`.

    thematic_on(bg = "#222222", fg = "white", accent = "#0CE3AC", font = "Oxanium")

    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), color = factor(cyl))) +
      geom_point() +
      ggrepel::geom_text_repel()

<img src="man/figures/README-ggrepel-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In addition to `thematic_on()`, which applies the provided theme to all
plots (up until `thematic_off()` is called), there are a few variation
of `thematic_on()` which temporarily apply the given theme:

-   `thematic_shiny()`: apply theme up until the next [Shiny](#shiny)
    app exits. Use this over `thematic_on()` in Shiny apps.
-   `thematic_rmd()`: apply theme up until the next [R Markdown](#rmd)
    document exits. Use this over `thematic_on()` in R Markdown
    documents.
-   `thematic_with_theme()`: apply theme up until the provided plot
    `expr` is evaluated. Use this to apply different themes to different
    plots within a Shiny app.
