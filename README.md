Simplified theming of `{ggplot2}`, `{lattice}`, and `{base}` R graphics.
In addition to providing a [centralized
approach](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/custom.html) to
styling R graphics, `{thematic}` also enables [automatic
styling](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html) of R
plots in Shiny, R Markdown, and RStudio.

## Installation

Install the stable release of `{thematic}` on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("thematic")
```

[Auto theming in
Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#shiny)
requires `{shiny}` 1.5.0 or higher:

``` r
install.packages("shiny")
```

[Auto theming in R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rmd)
requires `{rmarkdown}` 2.7 or higher:

``` r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Using themes with [custom
fonts](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/fonts.html) works
best if you have `{showtext}` and/or `{ragg}` installed.

``` r
install.packages("showtext")
install.packages("ragg")
```

## Overview

`{thematic}`’s [auto
theming](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html) gives R
plots the ability to style themselves inside
[Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#shiny)
(via CSS), [R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rmd)
(via `{bslib}`), and
[RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/articles/auto.html#rstudio)
(via [RStudio
themes](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes)).
For a quick example, here’s a `shiny::tabsetPanel()` with custom CSS
styling, but default R styling:

``` r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(bslib)

# Uncomment the next line to use thematic with this app:
# thematic::thematic_shiny(font = "auto")

ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bs_theme(
    bg = "#002B36", fg = "#EEE8D5", primary = "#2AA198",
    base_font = font_google("Pacifico")
  ),
  tabsetPanel(
    type = "pills",
    tabPanel("ggplot", plotOutput("ggplot")),
    tabPanel("lattice", plotOutput("lattice")),
    tabPanel("base", plotOutput("base"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$ggplot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), color = factor(cyl))) +
      geom_point() +
      ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
  })
  output$lattice <- renderPlot({
    lattice::show.settings()
  })
  output$base <- renderPlot({
    image(volcano, col = thematic_get_option("sequential"))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

To add automatic coloring *and fonts* (i.e., the full auto theming
experience) to the R plots, simply call `thematic_shiny(font = "auto")`
and re-run the application. Since the plots are generated via Shiny,
they assume new defaults which are informed by the CSS styling on their
HTML container (that is, notice how the R plots now reflect the styling
of the `shiny::tabsetPanel()`). Moreover, as long as the relevant font
is a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) (in this case,
[Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico)), `{thematic}`
automatically downloads, caches, and registers font(s) with R.

``` r
# Turn on thematic and re-run the app
thematic::thematic_shiny(font = "auto")
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

<img src="man/figures/auto-after.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Instead of relying on `{thematic}` to automatically detect colors and
fonts in the plot’s container, you can also specify them directly in
`thematic_on()`.

``` r
thematic_on(bg = "#222222", fg = "white", accent = "#0CE3AC", font = "Oxanium")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-ggrepel-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In addition to `thematic_on()`, which applies the provided theme to all
plots (up until `thematic_off()` is called), there are a few variation
of `thematic_on()` which temporarily apply the given theme:

-   `thematic_shiny()`: apply theme up until the next [Shiny](#shiny)
    app exits. Use this over `thematic_on()` in Shiny apps.
-   `thematic_rmd()`: apply theme up until the next [R Markdown](#rmd)
    document exits. Use this over `thematic_on()` in R Markdown
    documents.
-   `thematic_with_theme()`: apply theme up until the provided plot
    `expr` is evaluated. Use this to apply different themes to different
    plots within a Shiny app.
