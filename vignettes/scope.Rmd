As we've learned in previous articles, `thematic_on()` works by modifying global state (i.e., it changes global `par()`, `palette()`, `ggplot2::theme_set()`, and various other settings). This makes it simple to start using **thematic** everywhere, but it comes at the cost of possibly introducing unwanted side-effects in other R code. `thematic_shiny()` and `thematic_rmd()` essentially solve this problem by automatically cleaning up after themselves in an Shiny and R Markdown context, but more generally, you might want lower-level tools for scoping **thematic** themes to a particular context.

### One-time use 

The recommended way to apply a **thematic** theme to a single plot is to use `thematic_with_theme()`. This requires a `thematic_theme()` object, which has the same arguments as `thematic_on()`, but just creates a theme object without activating it.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_purple <- thematic_theme("black", "white", accent = "purple")
ggsmooth <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggsmooth 
thematic_with_theme(theme_purple, ggsmooth)
```

`thematic_with_theme()` is particularly useful for use inside a **shiny** app where you might want to only apply **thematic** to specific plots and/or use different themes for different plots:

```r
library(shiny)
library(thematic)

purple <- thematic_theme(accent = "purple")
orange <- thematic_theme(accent = "orange")

ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = shinythemes::shinytheme("darkly"),
  plotOutput("purple"),
  plotOutput("orange")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$purple <- renderPlot({
    thematic_with_theme(purple, {
      ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions)) +
        geom_raster(aes(fill = density))
    })
  })
  output$orange <- renderPlot({
    thematic_with_theme(orange, {
      ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions)) +
        geom_raster(aes(fill = density))
    })
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("with-theme-shiny.png")
```

If you find it annoying to supply both the `thematic_theme()` and the plot `expr` to the same function call, you can also use `thematic_local_theme()`, which cleans up after itself when R exits the current execution environment. The one catch is that, in this case, you currently have to `print()` **ggplot2** and **lattice** objects. By the way, if your interesting in learning more about how `thematic_local_theme()` actually works, and where else it might be useful (unit tests!), check out [this blog post by Jenny Bryan](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/).

```r
p <- ggplot(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = density))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$purple <- renderPlot({
    thematic_local_theme(purple)
    
     print(p)
  })
  output$orange <- renderPlot({
    thematic_local_theme(orange) 
    
     print(p)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


### Several-time use

To apply **thematic** to several plots at a time, consider using `thematic_on()` to modify state and `thematic_set_theme()` to restore state. Since `thematic_on()` returns a theme object that represents the previously set theme (and, if none, returns `NULL`), we can use a pattern like this to set a theme for two plots, then restore the previous theme:

```{r}
old_theme <- thematic_on("black", "white", accent = NA)
plot(1:10)
qplot(1:10)
# equivalent of thematic_off() if old_theme is NULL
thematic_set_theme(old_theme)
```

```{r, dev.args = list(bg = "white")}
plot(1:10)
```

When writing your own functions, this pattern useful in conjunction with `on.exit()` to temporarily apply a theme in such a way that, even if the function errors out, the previous state is still restored.

```{r}
my_plot_function <- function(...) {
  old_theme <- thematic_on("black", "white")
  on.exit(thematic_set_theme(old_theme), add = TRUE)
  # do stuff with ...
}
```
