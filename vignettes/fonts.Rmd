## Google Fonts {#google-fonts}

If a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) is requested as part of a **thematic** theme, **thematic** attempts to download, cache, and register that font for use with **showtext** and **ragg** before plotting (see `font_spec()` for more details). Therefore, to correctly render these fonts, you'll need at least **showtext** or **ragg** installed; and in some scenarios, some additional configuration may be required.

**showtext** allows fonts to be used with essentially any R graphics device. Therefore, it's likely preferable when high-quality devices (e.g. `png(type='quartz')`, `svg()`, `cairo_pdf()`, etc). Unfortunately, in many cases, hosted environments (e.g., shinyapps.io and Connect) don't have `png(type='quartz')` support, and `shiny::renderPlot()` currently requires a png file, so **ragg** is likely preferable in that case. **ragg** is also faster and more consistent (across cross-platforms) than other bitmap devices such as `png(type='cairo')`, see [here](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) for more details.

### Shiny & R Markdown {#shiny-rmd}

If you have **showtext** installed, Google Fonts should 'just work' by default inside Shiny and R Markdown. Before deployment, include `library(showtext)` in the app/document to make sure it's installed on the hosted instance. Also, if you encounter issues in R Markdown, make sure **thematic** is being loaded in an initial "setup" chunk prior to any plotting chunks (loading **thematic** ensures that the `fig.showtext` **knitr** option defaults to `TRUE` in future code chunks).

Using **ragg** instead of **showtext** in these contexts requires some additional configuration:
  * Set `options(shiny.useragg = TRUE)` in Shiny (requires **shiny** v1.5.0 or higher).
  * Set `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")` in R Markdown (requires **knitr** v1.29 or higher).

### RStudio {#rstudio}

The suggested way to render Google Fonts in RStudio is to leverage [RStudio 1.4](https://dailies.rstudio.com)'s configurable graphics device option with an AGG backend, which requires the **ragg** package. After **ragg** is installed, in RStudio, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Graphics -> Backend:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("backend.png")
```

If it's not possible for you to use the AGG backend, you _can_ get Google Fonts rendering in RStudio by running this code at the start of an R session:

```r
trace(grDevices::png, exit = quote({
   showtext::showtext_begin()
}), print = FALSE)
```

Note that this code will make sure _any_ call to `png()` uses **showtext**, so you may want to disable it if it happens to introduce unwanted side-effects.

```r
untrace(grDevices::png)
```

### R graphics devices {#r-devices}

In theory, as long as **showtext** is installed, Google Fonts should render on any R graphics device. Here's a mini example with `svglite::svglite()`:

```r
thematic_on("black", "white", font = "Pacifico")
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".svg")
svglite::svglite(tmp, width = 7, height = 3)
plot(1, type = "n")
text(1, "Pacifico font")
dev.off()
if (rstudioapi::isAvailable()) file.show(tmp)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("svglite.svg")
```

Note that **thematic** also includes a `thematic_save_plot()` that is essentially a convenience function for saving a plot to a graphics device, but also does the following:

* Ensures the graphics device is informed by `thematic_get_option("bg")`.
* Ensures that **showtext** is aware of the device's resolution (`res`), which is important to get the font sizes right in bitmap images (e.g., png, jpeg, etc).
* Ensures that **thematic** is able to properly clone the device when determining if the device has support for the rendering a requested font.

```r
# Makes a high-res png image
file <- thematic_save_plot(plot(1:10), res = 216)
if (rstudioapi::isAvailable()) file.show(tmp)
```

## Other Fonts {#other-fonts}

Other fonts that already known to R require no additional setup for use with **thematic**. One way to make a font family generally available to R is to import them via the [**extrafont** package](https://github.com/wch/extrafont). You can also register a font for use with **showtext** via `sysfonts::font_add()` and with **ragg** via `systemfonts::register_font()`. The benefit of the **sysfonts**/**systemfonts** approach is that registration is much much faster, and generally works better, but registration must also be (re)-done in every new R session.
