## Google Fonts {#google-fonts}

If a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) is requested as part of a **thematic** theme, **thematic** attempts to download, cache, and register that font for use with **showtext** and **ragg** before plotting (see `font_spec()` for more details). Therefore, to correctly render these fonts, you'll need at least **showtext** or **ragg** installed; and in some scenarios, some additional configuration may be required.

**showtext** allows custom fonts to be used with essentially any R graphics device, whereas **ragg** itself provides (high-quality and cross-platform) bitmap devices with 1st class support for custom fonts. Therefore, consider using **showtext** for vector-based images (i.e., `svg()`, `cairo_pdf()`, etc) and **ragg** for raster-based images (i.e., `ragg::agg_png()`, `ragg::agg_jpeg()`, etc). Note that `shiny::renderPlot()` currently requires a png image, so **ragg** is generally preferable to **showtext** in that case, especially on hosted environments (e.g., Connect, shinyapps.io, etc. -- because they don't have support for the high-quality `quartz()` device).

### Shiny & R Markdown {#shiny-rmd}

If you have **showtext** installed, Google Fonts should 'just work' by default inside Shiny and R Markdown. However, before deployment, include `library(showtext)` in the app/document to make sure it's installed on the hosted instance. Also, if you encounter issues in R Markdown, make sure **thematic** is being loaded in an initial "setup" chunk prior to any plotting chunks (loading **thematic** ensures that the `fig.showtext` **knitr** option defaults to `TRUE` in future code chunks).

Using **ragg** instead of **showtext** in these contexts requires some additional configuration:
  * Set `options(shiny.useragg = TRUE)` in Shiny (requires **shiny** v1.5.0 or higher).
  * Set `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")` in R Markdown (requires **knitr** v1.29 or higher).

### R graphics devices {#r-devices}

In theory, as long as **showtext** is installed, Google Fonts should render on any R graphics device. Here's a mini example with `svglite::svglite()`:

```r
thematic_on("black", "white", font = "Pacifico")
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".svg")
svglite::svglite(tmp, width = 7, height = 3)
plot(1, type = "n")
text(1, "Pacifico font")
dev.off()
if (rstudioapi::isAvailable()) file.show(tmp)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("svglite.svg")
```

Note that **thematic** also includes a `thematic_save_plot()` that is essentially a convenience function for saving a plot to a graphics device, but also does the following:

* Ensures the graphics device is informed by `thematic_get_option("bg")`.
* Ensures that **showtext** is aware of the device's resolution (`res`), which is important to get the font sizes right in bitmap images (e.g., png, jpeg, etc).
* Ensures that **thematic** is able to properly clone the device when determining if the device has support for the rendering a requested font.

```r
# Makes a high-res png image
file <- thematic_save_plot(plot(1:10), res = 216)
if (rstudioapi::isAvailable()) file.show(tmp)
```

## Other Fonts {#other-fonts}

Other fonts that already known to R require no additional setup for use with **thematic**. One way to make a font family generally available to R is to import them via the [**extrafont** package](https://github.com/wch/extrafont). You can also register a font for use with **showtext** via `sysfonts::font_add()` and with **ragg** via `systemfonts::register_font()`. The benefit of the **sysfonts**/**systemfonts** approach is that registration is much much faster, and generally works better, but registration must also be (re)-done in every new R session.
